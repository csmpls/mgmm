hi nick
how do you feel?
.
what's the big goal today?
.
if there's time left over, what's the next goal today?
.
what's the plan with talia today?
.
what's the plan with marijuana today?
.
what's the plan with work over the next few months?
.
what's the biggest project to work on right now?
.
what's the most important thing to do besides that project?
.
what's the next most important thing? (i.e. that thing you //just// can't leave out)?
.
what's the thing you'd ideally like to work on today?
.
what's the thing you're surprised to not be mentioned already?
.
how are you feeling?
.
what did you dream about?
.
ah, maybe you didn't remember to dream.
you might consider setting up a dream diary.
this is slightly different from mgmm, but not much different.
remember the vision of this as a multiplexed screen with me in the far-left much-abridged window
there must be a way to do it with bash scripts, or other python scripts
maybe a few python scripts are set up and i pick up which one to do on the night before
maybe each comes with a script for editing itself
maybe this emails itself to ohlife somehow, after i finish. or it posts itself to a private blog... yes, perhaps through hakyll somewhere on my ubuntu one acct fx...
any comments?
.
what's the most important thing for you to accomplish this summer?
.
if there's time, what's the second most important?
.
what's the thing you just //can't// go on without mentioning?
.
okay, have a good day nick.
