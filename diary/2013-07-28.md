> how are you feeling?

well


> what were you dreaming about?

i don't remember anythin


> when do you think you'll most likely be tempted to use today?

i'm not sure. lately when i'm moving around montreal i don't crave too much. cigarettes contribute to that.


> what are some ways you can transmute the want to use into something positive? into getting the experience you really want?

when i want to smoke anything -- a cigarette, anything -- think of a way to explore my immediate vicinity


> what's a fond memory that comes to mind?

yesterday, the nice time of day, me dan sarah leave the bookstore, wander the street in  the earliest evening, find poutine to eat in a shop that doesn't speak any english


> what motivates you at this very moment?

exploring. seeing montreal.


> how can you leverage that motivation to move toward something you //really// want?

whenever i'm tired, can't move see furher physically, go somewhere mentally you can't go.  the most generative of new ideas - boredom!


> strong feelings today




> strong feeings and strong work




> king of swords




> page of pentacles
