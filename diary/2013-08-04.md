#morning


> what were you dreaming about?

i can't really remember. i did dream though.


> how are you feeling?

i feel alright. hip problems after pulse. energized though and glad i went


> did you see a new card?

RETREAT  backing away on a plan. defeat if ill-dignified. otherwise re-strategizing, re-planning, acknowledging mistakes.


> draw a tarot




> any thoughts?

ungood omen -- the tower->eight of swords // crisis got me bound || king of cups->seven of cups reversed \\ i will complete some sort of project, something...


> what can you do to make today truly fucking excellent?

drones. draw. and write.  (with music, of course, everlasting..)


> zones today




> zones and notebook




> anything else that catches your mind?

no. new experiments today with zones. sober zones. so this is an experiment in and of itself. (an experiment is something the outcome of which is unknown)
