> what's the very first move on twirk?

describe the objective. describe the first technical moves.


> now describe the next move.

make an attractive, brief and readable git readme. send it to adam.


> what's a way to get better at making drones?

i think it's to learn something i've already recorded.  practice it, play it again.  then play over it.


> morning is just questions




> daytime is mostly an oracle




> this is good evening machine.




> any thoughts?

i think oracle may be a better first step. i //can// do mgmm quietly already - just "talk" in any screen. 


> yes, i realize morning is quick notes as well, and that these notes go to daytime. not right now though.




> talk about what you'll do for other people today.

be a good guest as sarah's house - help out and make it worth her time to host us all. just by mbeing like jahar - making everyone feel open and pure and clean and positive


> you'll do just one thing for 'work' (yourself) today. describe it, and what steps you'll take on it.

wow, i guess it's the twirk repo.  starting a git readme that really describes this project; its design, motivation and immediate steps.  a bunch of issues that describe the research/prototype phase. that's it i suppose. that's enough work....


> nick, be excellent today
