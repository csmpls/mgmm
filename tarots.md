0 THE FOOL - Everyman
The Fool represents human nature with all its strengths and weaknesses in a state of innocence.   He is supported by his dog for good or ill.
Idea, thought, spirituallity, that which endeavors to rise above the material (if the subject which is enquired about be spiritual).  If the Divination refers to a material event of ordinary life, this card is not good, and shows folly, stupidity, eccentricity and even mania, unless offset by very good cards.
Listen to your wiser self.  This card alerts you to your weaknesses and stresses that self-awareness is the key to psychological and spiritual wholeness.  It urges you to think twice: thoughtless action leads to regrets.  Immature behaviour, folly and indescretion will cause difficulty in any sphere of your life.  If you are at the outset of a new project, you should examine the situation closely.  Perhaps you have been viewing it through rose-colored spectacles?
It is too ideal and unstable to be generally good in material things.

1 THE MAGICIAN - Skill, adaptability
Skill, wisdom,adaptation.  Craft, cunning, etc.
The Magician presides over all the suits of the Minor Arcana and may call on them to further his own progress and development.  His hat bears a horizontal representation of the figure 8 - the figure attributed to Hermes in occultism.  The Magician is original, creative and flexible but he is also very cunning and capable of manipulating others for good or ill.
This card suggests that you should not be apprehensive about taking positive and determined action.  Weakness of will and an unoriginal approach will impede progress.  You are in a strong position to influence others; be compassionate but forceful.
Always depending on neighboring cards.  Sometimes occult wisdom.

2 THE HIGH PRIESTESS - Discrimination
Change, alteration, increase and decrease. Fluctuation, whether for good or evil, is shown by cards connected with it.  (Compare with DEATH and THE MOON).
Quintessentially feminine, the High Priestess poses a challenge to masculine dominance.  She is usually shown reading a book and her expression is calm - but does her composure merely serve to mask her emotions?
The High Priestess symbolizes wisdom.  She is willing to share her knowledge with others and advises introspection.  Listen to what others have to say but analyse it carefully.  Be organized and discreet; hidden influences may be at work.  Let intuition and your positive emotional responses guide you.  The High Priestess also has a bearing on health and diet and is perhaps urging you to review these two areas of your life.

3 THE EMPRESS - Security
Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success, also luxury and sometimes dissipation, but only if with very evil cards.
The Emperior's consort and the feminine principle, the Empress represents desire in all its forms.  She symbolizes emotional and financial security, suggesting an enjoyment of earhly pleasures and material comfort.  Often depicted as pregnant, she stresses fertility and fruitful union.  She brings harmony and partnership to personal or business relationships.  Her nature is creative and resolute, passionate and honest.  She may represent any dominant female in your life: mother, daughter or wife.
Be confident and decisive in financial matters but also diplomatic.  If you are about to make an important decision, she warns you not to be tempted to take the line of least resistance.  An assertive approach will bring success.  You may have to help your partner; be encouraging and supportive and motivate him or her for your mutual progress, but beware of being too possessive.  Resist the temptation to squander money or to take part in backbiting.

4 THE EMPEROR - Action
War, conquest, victory, strife, ambition.
The Emperor signifies temporal power achieved through action.  He has attained his position of authority by virtue of his brave and energetic approach.  Formerly aggressive and violent, he is now mellowing, although he is still a fiery character prone to impulsive and extravert behaviour.  He has nonetheless learnt from experience and gained wisdom.  He is the archetypical male, assuming the roles of father, brother and husband, as the Empress (his companion) represents the female counterparts.
The Emperor bestows strength and firmness in the attainment of goals.  He suggests we channel our energy and use it postitively.  His advice offers the benefit of his experience: be wary of premature behaviour.  He appreciates the strength of the desire to win, but the means to victory should not involve a ruthless attitude towards other people.  With power comes responsibility.  Don't let your passionate nature rule your head.

5 THE HIEROPHANT - Enlightenment
Divine wisdom, manifestation, explanation, teaching.  Differing from, though resembling in some respects, the meanings of the MAGICIAN, THE HERMIT and THE LOVERS.  Occult wisdom.
The Hierophant (or Pope) wears the triple crown - symbol of power in the three worlds of Man, the Soul and Eternity.  His authority is absolute, but he is a sympathetic and compassionate ruler.  He is merciful and just and sets a good example.  He encourages you to stick by the rules - perhaps the rules of your own conscience.  You have the right to choose to obey or disobey him.
The Hierophant stresses the value of integrity: look deep into your heart, then act with the courage of your convictions.  Banish superficial considerations and focus your mind on more important matters.

6 THE LOVERS - Harmony, choice
Inspiration (passive and in some cases mediumistic, thus differing from that of the HIEROPHANT, MAGICIAN and HERMIT).  Motive power, and action, arising from Inspiration and Impulse.
A virgin is sacrificed to a Great Beast, but her Lover is there to rescue her.  In some sense the Hero represents "Virtue", and the Beast "Vice", which represent alternatives and imply that a choice needs to be made.  In other packs a couple are shown echanging marrage vows.  The card is rich in symbolism; on one level it represents human love in its finest form, but there is also an implicit warning: the Hero inflames the passions, and the Lover must preserve a sense of honour and trust if a long and lasting spiritual love, as well as sensual pleasure, is to bless their union.
If embarking on a new love affair or trying to revitalize an existing relationship, remember the Lover's warning: Don't fall in love with love, this may be just an infatuation.

7 THE CHARIOT - Vitality
Triumph, victory, health, success, though sometimes not stable or enduring.
A handsome young hero rides resplendent in his chariot.  He represents youth, movement, achievement and popularity.  He appears to have been in battle and is returning home triamphant.  His two horses, sometimes depicted as sphinxes, represent the spiritual and sexual drives, but there is a hint of conflict here as the two appear to be travelling in opposite directions.
The over-riding message of this card is to have faith in yourself.  It stresses victory through self-awareness.  Our capacity for achievement is a measure of our ability to balance mental and physical strength.  Success will come through a combination of hard work and careful reflection.  You should be feeling optimistic, but are you pushing yourself to your full intellectual capacity?  Now is the time to fulfil your potential.  This card is also auspicious for travellers.

8 STRENGTH - Fortitude, Conquest
Courage, strength, fortitude.  Power not arrested in the act of judgment, but passing on to further action.  Sometimes obstinancy.  (Compare with JUSTICE).
A beautiful woman has tamed a lion and seems to be in complete control.  Gentle determination gets the better of brute strength - the iron hand in the velvet glove.  Like the Magician, an implied figure 8 (the occult number attributed to Hermes or Mercury) is in her hair.  This symbolyses the combination of conscious and unconscious power.
This card advises you to develop your powers of understanding by listening to your intuition.  The obsticles that appear to be impending your progress may be imaginary.  Self-awarness breeds confidence and is the best route to success.  You have spiritual power on your side, so rid yourself of nebulous worries and take determined action.

9 THE HERMIT - Truth, prudence
Wisdom sought for and obtained from above.  Divine inspiration, but active as opposed to that of THE LOVERS.  In the mystical titles, this card and the HIEROPHANT and the MAGICIAN comprise the three Magi.
Although the Hermit has aquired sage-like wisdom and experience during a long life, he continues to seek truth.  His lamp symbolyzes his continual quest for knowledge.  Occaisionally he may withdraw from the world but he also realizes that too much knowledge can become a responsibility, and is therefore willing to put it to practicle use by counselling others.
The Hermit stresses the value of wisdom; he may use this either to his benifit or that of other people.  He warns you never to assume you know everything there is to know.  Keep an open mind in all situations and be receptive to new developments.  Perhaps you should withdraw and assess your situation critically.  Be cautious in your actions and discriminating in your choice of friends and colleagues.  The Hermit's ability to stand back from a situation allows him to remain flexible and avoid stubborness.

10 WHEEL OF FORTUNE - Equilibrium change
Good fortune and happiness (within bounds), but sometimes also a species of intoxication with success, if the neighboring cards bear this out.
Two creatures, a monkey and a sphinx, are trying to balence onthe ever-turning wheel of fortune.  The monkey has followed the downward path, whilst the sphinx is at the peak, he looks confident but the wheel of fortune is in perpetual motion, so his security is questionable.  Some decks show the angel, lion, ox and eagle (evangelist symbols) in the cards corners to represent permanency in anever changing world.
The menagerie reminds us of change: the flux of fortune and the fine balance between success and failure.  You may be about to enter a new cycle, or perhaps you are coming to the end of a problematic period.  In either case your circumstances are about to change.

11 JUSTICE - Balance
Eternal justice and balance.  Strength and force, but arrested as in the act of judgment.  (Compare with STRENGTH).  Also, in combination with other cards, legal proceedings, a court of law, a trial at law, etc.
Justice maintains the balance between positive and negative.  She is equable and fair.  The pillars behind her throne represent moral strength and integrity.  She has the gift of clear judgment; the ability to differentiate between right and wrong.
Justice advises you to be reasonable, impartial and restrained.  However, this does not mean you should sit on the fence and refuse to make a decision.  She is essentially practical and encourages you to analyse your situation practically.  Perhaps you should be more self critical, but don't dwell on problems for too long; worry can be self-defeating if it is not applied practically.

12 THE HANGED MAN - Transition
Enforced sacrifice, punishment, loss.  Fatal and not voluntary.  Suffering generally.
The Hanged Man here is very much alive.  He is in a state of inactivity, perhaps experiencing a moment of calm before the truth is revealed.  If you are not familiar with the Tarot's symbolism, you may find this violent image somewhat alarming, but the Hanged Man does not represent physical pain.  It is a symbol which has been traced to the Florentine custom of painting criminals on walls: if they were still at large they were shown hanging by the ankle as in this card.
The Hanged Man may herald a change of mind or opinion, or perhaps signify a period of respite between two events.  Be patient, use this time wisely to collect your thoughts.  You will instinctively know when the time is right to move on. Rest, but don't completely relax your guard - you may have a rival working against you, causing more havoc than you realize.  Be alert.

13 DEATH - Change
Time, ages, transformation.  Sometimes death and destruction, but rarely the latter, and only if it is borne out by the cards with it.  (Compare also with THE HIGH PRIESTESS).
At first glance this image is very disturbing, as people who do not know the message of the cards instantly assume that it predicts death.  However, the figure of death is merely a symbol and does not speak of our death or that of loved ones.  The macabre skeleton is clearing the ground with his scythe so that new plants have enough space to grow.
The Death card stresses the need to make a clean sweep.  It does not speak of physical death but that of an era.  Accept the need for change and do not try to obstruct its course.  Not all change need be self-generated; some may come about as a result of fate.  Whatever the nature of the change, it will be to your eventual advantage so welcome the chance of a new beginning.  The Reaper (as he is sometimes called) heralds rebirth, new enterprises or new phases in love.

14 TEMPERANCE - Moderation
Combination of forces, realization, action (material).  Effect either for good or evil.
Temperance is orderly, disciplined and careful.  She is in control of the situation, able to transfer water from one urn to the other without spilling a drop.  The water is said to represent the essence of life, and her action may be seen to symbolize the merger of past with future.  The difficulty of her task emphasizes the value she places on diligence.  She is a kindly mother figure who urges hard work.  The open landscape stretching behind her may symbolize oppertunity.  She is also said to be the Angel of the Moon, and is often shown standing by a flowing river.
The symbols of water and the Moon are traditionally associated with the emotions.  The figure of Temperance in this context therefore advises you to control your emotions.  A sense of fulfilment, peace and harmony will result.  The open landscape stretching behind her suggests you draw on your natural resources: use your talents to attain your goals.  Work hard and your efforts will be rewarded, and strive for harmony in your relationships with others.  You are probably btter liked and more respected than you imagine.  You may be about to deepen an emotional relationship.  If so, this card is very positive.

15 THE DEVIL - Self-awareness
Materiallity, material force, material temptation; sometimes obsession, especially if associated with THE LOVERS.
The Devil is one of the most striking figures of the pack; a macabre (in some packs androgynous) figure, his image dominates the card.  Man is represented by the two figures tethered to his pedisal.  But look carefully, their bonds are not secure and they could easily slip through them.
This card holds a warning: the individual is not trapped, but merely thinks he is.  You can liberate yourself from the chains that bind you and beat the devil within.  The Devil never disappears entirely, but you can counteract his influence by being aware of your weaknesses.  Don't rely on others or allow yourself to be tempted into lazy, self destructive ways.

16 THE TOWER - Risk, breakthrough
Ambition, fighting, war, courage.  (Compare with THE EMPEROR).  In certain combinations, destruction, danger, ruin, fall.
A bolt of lightening strikes down a solid tower.  This violent image symbolizes a great revelation: truth shattering an illusion.  The Tower represents old beliefs and appears to be firm, but it cannot withstand the natural force of the lightening.  In this pack the Tower has no windows, emphasizing the limited outlook from the Tower.
This violent image creates an instant impression of destruction, indicating shattered illusion, revelation or drastic change.  It represents a complete break with the past.  You are likely to take risks in the near future.  Tread carefully, you are also very accident-prone at the moment.  Expect the unexpected and be confident that, whatever the change, it will be to your eventual advantage.

17 THE STAR - Hope
Hope, faith, unexpected help.  Sometimes also dreaminess, deceived hope, etc.
The maiden on the card is called Proserpine, traditionally destined to spend one-third of the year with Pluto, King of the Underworld, and the rest of the time with her mother Ceres.  She is pouring the water of life and bringing moisture and thus fertility to earth.  The large star is that seen by the Magi; the seven smaller ones represent hope.  The promise of renewal is reinforced by the dove and shrubs in the background.
Prosperine tells us to be optimistic and positive.  She represents pure spiritual love which lends insight.  The presence of this card in a reading begs a question - have you been too restless or superficial in the past?  The influence of the Star is positive.  Your outlook is bright and you are continually becoming psychologically stronger.  You may be feeling restless; be conservative, this is a good time to make firm decisions about your long term future.  Don't allow negative thoughts, worries or inhibitions to obstruct your progress.  Be determined but remain sympathetic to others.  Consistent effort will be rewarded.

18 THE MOON - Susceptibility, deception
Dissatisfaction, voluntry change (as opposed to DEATH).  Error, lies, falsehoods, deception.  The whole according to wether the card is well- or ill-dignified, on which it much depends.
The Moon herself is the dominant image of this card.  She is beautiful but, like moonlight, can also be deceptive.  Note too how the dogs, supposedly man's best friend, look like wolves.  The presence of the crab, or crayfish in the water below symbolizes fears or inhibitions, and reinforces this card's emphasis on the hidden.
Above all, the Moon warns against self-deception.  You should ask yourself whether the conditions of your life are what they appear to be.  Could you be labouring under some illusion?  The presence of the crab or crayfish points to our inner fears, the hidden anxieties which prevent positive psychological development.  Perhaps your emotions are affecting your judgment.  You may have been overemotional or perhaps you have overreacted to a situation.  Be wary of false friends or rivals.

19 THE SUN - Joy
Glory, gain, riches.  Sometimes also arrogance.  Display, vanity, but only when surrounded by very evil cards.
The Sun heaps energy, warmth and happiness on a young, contented couple who are about to embrace.  They appear trusting and uninhibited; an example of pure love.  They represent contentment, fulfilment and true friendship.  Even so, the Sun also has a harsher side; its rays can be damaging.
Fire is a good servent but a cruel master.  Do not be lulled into a false sense of security by the apparently positive influence ruling your life at present.  Avoid the trap of complacency.  The Sun gives vitality, energy and creative power - exploit these talents to the full.  Take pleasure from pure, simple things and the arts.  The Sun is a particularly auspicious card if you are about to marry or have a child.  The message is essentially positive, but it does carry a warning: beware of pride.

20 JUDGMENT - Transformation
Final decision, judgment, sentence.  Determination of a matter without appeal on its plane.
An angel summons men from their graves.  The figure appears to be offering atonement for past mistakes and the possibility of a new beginning.  Misdemeanours are being exposed and absolved, allowing sinners to be transformed and to live their lives on a higher plane of existence
This card calls for self-analysis.  It suggests that if you examine your faults and weaknesses, awareness of them will transform you and make you more sympathetic, less resentful and therefore more humanitarian.  Perhaps you need to forgive and forget; bitterness can be a canker of the spirit.  Be careful that no one is taking unfair advantage of you, but also be honest with yourself, consider your own actions.  These may be adversely affecting other people.  If this is the case, the consequences are not irremediable.  The symbolism of ressurection in this card indicates a second chance.

21 THE UNIVERSE - Achievement
The matter itself, synthesis, world, kingdom.  Usually denotes the actual subject of the question, and therefore depends entirely on the accompanying cards.
In modern terms this woman has "made it" and is surrounded by a string of perls, symbol of success.  A lion and a bull support her and an angel and eagle, symbolically the guardians of truth, are over her.
Success and fulfilment, both worldly and spiritual, are indicated by this card.  Your efforts are about to be rewarded.  You are entering a very positive phase during which you will enjoy the fruits of your labour.  You are experienced in worldly matters and you will use your knowledge wisely for your own benefit and that of others.  As the last card of the Major Arcanna, the Universe represents the end of a journey, the ultimate: enjoy your work, leisure and love.

She may be a messenger bearing an invitation or news of an oppertunity.  She is dreamy and has difficulty concentrating.  She may be someone in love.  Her preoccupied state of mind may serve as a warning: be on your guard against trickery or deception.

PRINCE OF CUPS
A young man with brown hair, grey or brown eyes.  He is subtle, violent, crafty and artistic.  A fierce nature with a calm exterior.  Powerful for good or evil, but more attracted by the evil, if allied with apparent power or wisdom.  Iff ill-dignified, he is intensely evil and merciless.
In some packs the Prince contemplates a fish in his cup in others he merely holds it obediently.  The card represents someone with the ability to step back from a situation, someone withdrawn and calm who can make objective judgements.  He is thoughtful studious and imaginative.

QUEEN OF CUPS
A woman with gold-brown hair and blue eyes.  She is imaginative, poetic, kind, yet not willing to take much trouble for another.  Coquettish, good-natured, underneath a dreamy appearance.  Imagination stronger than feeling.  Very much affected by other influences, and therefore more dependent upon good or ill-dignity than most other symbols.
Like her husband, the Queen holds her cup with great confidence.  Her throne is solid and protective, at her left hand is a sacred Ibex.  She is a warm-hearted woman poetic yet practical, intelligent honest and imaginative.

KING OF CUPS
A man with fair hair and blue eyes.  Graceful, poetic, venusion, indolent, but enthusiastic if aroused.  Ill-dignified he is sensual, idle, and untruthful.

He appears disinterested in his coin (and in some packs has lost it).

The type of person signified by the Prince is not necessarily a student, but can be anyone with a tendency to become absorbed in a subject.

QUEEN OF PENTACLES
A woman with dark hair and dark eyes.  She is impetuous, kind, timid, rather charming, great-hearted, intelligent, melancholy, truthful, yet of many moods.  Ill-dignified, she is undecided, capricious, foolish, changable.

KING OF PENTACLES
A man with dark eyes and dark hair.  Unless very well-dignified, he is heavy, dull, and material.  Laborious, cleaver and patient in material matters.  If ill-dignified, he is avericious, grasping, dull, jealous, not very courageous, unless assisted by other symbols.
The king proudly displays his septre.  The person represented by this card is a successful man with sharp business acumen who seldom misses an oppertunity to increase his wealth.  He prizes financial and material comfort very highly.  He is a loyal friend whose faults are a tendency to gamble or over-invest.

ACE OF SWORDS
Invoked force as contrasted with natural Force; for it is the invocation of the Sword.
Raised upward, it invokes the Divine Crown of Spiritual Brightness.  But ill-dignified, it is the invocation of demoniac force, and becomes a farfully evil symbol.  It represnts therefore very great power for good or evil, but invoked.  Also it represents whirling force and strength through trouble.  It is the affirmation of justice, upholding Dvine authority; it may become the sword of wrath, punishment and affliction.
