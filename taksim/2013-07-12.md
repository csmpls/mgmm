probably stuff cycling around in 3D space. urgent tasks are generally closer to the screen and larger. the small tasks are basically just floating around in front of them.


> what's your deepest insight on what shaz wants it to look like?

like it fits in his fucking office.... imagine a black background with small white spheres hovering around. big spheres have the name right in there like it's iOS7 (but not - your take on it) ((u see it? white dots with little gray text in em...maybe it's a kinda lighter gray backgroundish too)) . u can definitely swtich between teh colors shaz dw. No but really. don't worry about te white on black, just worry about that clean scandinavian idea of displaying information. straightforwrad. visible. dieter reims would approve. 


> describe a visualization for me:

clean lookin background, white circles display information in bubbles - sometimes darker and larger - sometimes gray text a bit smaller - otherwise just floating around, you have to mouseover em if you wanna see what they say and they'll kinda stand still when you're doing that, repel other circles

test etste stset
