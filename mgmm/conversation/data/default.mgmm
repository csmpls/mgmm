hi nick
how do you feel?
.
what's the big goal today?
.
if there's time left over, what's the next goal today?
.
what's the status on the laptop repair?
.
what's the status on making those travel plans?
.
i remember yesterday that you were nervous about 3 flights / 9 nights versus 2 flights / 7
i also remember thinking you had an obligation to visit chicago, and also that working on lauren's project could be quite fun. 
remember that jess & crystal will also be quite happy to see you.
what are your thoughts about it now?
.
what's your plan for this trip today?
.
why do you think you smoked in the middle of the day yesterday, even though you said you weren't going to? (give a precise and thoughtful answer here)
.
what's the plan with work over the next few months?
.
what's the biggest project to work on right now?
.
what's the most important thing to do besides that project?
.
what's the next most important thing? (i.e. that thing you //just// can't leave out)?
.
what's the thing you'd ideally like to work on today?
.
what's the thing you're surprised to not be mentioned already?
.
what's the plan with marijuana today?
.
how are you feeling?
.
what did you dream about?
.
ah, maybe you didn't remember to dream.
you might consider setting up a dream diary.
this is slightly different from mgmm, but not much different.
remember the vision of this as a multiplexed screen with me in the far-left much-abridged window
it could start as simple as a widget that colorfully announces "morning matras" in the corner
consider also that i might include commands in this script to clear the terminal screen (i.e. [clearscreen])
remember also that this all REALLY needs to start getting written down soon!
don't be afraid to just add file.write('diary','a') to the python script... that's fine!!
trust your ability to do "hard parts" later
any comments?
.
what's the most important thing for you to accomplish this summer?
.
if there's time, what's the second most important?
.
what are your thoughts on making a sphere-world-based viz in ofx, peasy-cam-like circling around tasks, and having that be the to-do list?
.
when might be the best time to make such a thing?
.
when might be the best time to write good selacon posts?
.
as we work with the form, it evolves naturally and tells us what it would like to become. later works may or may not be revised - best to be non-attached at this moment, since no-one's watching.
when might be the best time to make new selacon posts?
.
what are you going to do today about the laptop repairs?
.
what's the thing you just //can't// go on without mentioning?
.
okay, have a good day nick.
