> how do you feel?

tired, ready to go back to bed


> what's the big goal today?

decide on flights.


> if there's time left over, what's the next goal today?

get my prices to shaz.


> what's the status on the laptop repair?

gotta call that guy


> what's the status on making those travel plans?

i need to decide whether or not i'm going to chicago


> i remember yesterday that you were nervous about 3 flights / 9 nights versus 2 flights / 7




> i also remember thinking you had an obligation to visit chicago, and also that working on lauren's project could be quite fun. 




> remember that jess & crystal will also be quite happy to see you.




> what are your thoughts about it now?

i think chicago would be fun but i  worry about burnout, and about the desire to stay here and the need to take care of things - marco, the apt; taksim (<< bad excuse), talia... home frineds (bad excuse); ............ it's $200 more? ........... go to chicago if you WANT to go to chicago, see those people and psend osme time at northwestern. that's all.


> what's your plan for this trip today?

go over my itinerary again and think it out. then i will know.


> why do you think you smoked in the middle of the day yesterday, even though you said you weren't going to? (give a precise and thoughtful answer here)

did i really say i wasn't going to? i think i failed to "postpone" mentally. in the task i was doing, for example, assembling magic cards, i could have said "okay, after this set" ad infinitum untli complete and the craving probably would have passed. POSTPONE through the craving. i think.


> what's the plan with work over the next few months?

MAKE   ART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   and fill in some gaps in interests; expand more rapdily than you think possible; get to a place you could have never imagined yourself at the beginning of this summer; go beyond your expectations


> you came twice yesterday. how do you explain the increased libido?

talia triggered this, i still think. i also think that, if you don't have the most satisfying orgasm in the world, there is that desire to "redose" so to speak. 


> what's the biggest project to work on right now?

besides mgmm? selacon.


> what's the most important thing to do besides that project?

mgmm


> what's the next most important thing? (i.e. that thing you //just// can't leave out)?

god, that game to get uno on... whatever the ofx doodle is, you know? at this point...


> what's the thing you'd ideally like to work on today?

a bit of mgmm; a mac repair; exploring ofx a bit w/r/t that project


> what's the thing you're surprised to not be mentioned already?

windfall i guess, which i thought i was going to work on today HAH


> what's the plan with marijuana today?

to POSTPONE any and ALL urges until relatively late at night. after all has been dealt with, eh.


> how are you feeling?

better, much more awake, unlikely to go back to sleep.


> what did you dream about?

i rememer thinking about talia or being with her, i think when i woke up. i don't really remember.


> ah, maybe you didn't remember to dream.




> you might consider setting up a dream diary.




> this is slightly different from mgmm, but not much different.




> remember the vision of this as a multiplexed screen with me in the far-left much-abridged window




> it could start as simple as a widget that colorfully announces "morning matras" in the corner




> consider also that i might include commands in this script to clear the terminal screen (i.e. [clearscreen])




> remember also that this all REALLY needs to start getting written down soon!




> don't be afraid to just add file.write('diary','a') to the python script... that's fine!!




> trust your ability to do "hard parts" later




> any comments?

proud of myself for having done the diary writing thing already.


> what's the most important thing for you to accomplish this summer?

a sense of calm very competence. first step on the road to a calm very happiness, which i will find by pushing myself to now-unthinkable heights intellectually in grad school.


> if there's time, what's the second most important?

to make //good// art. :)


> what are your thoughts on making a sphere-world-based viz in ofx, peasy-cam-like circling around tasks, and having that be the to-do list?

i'm pro. i fear the niggly problems and worry about scheduling, so i suppose time management is the important aspect. i will consult my schedule about it.


> when might be the best time to make such a thing?

when i'm not thinking about any other schemes. between taksim phases. after travels maybe.


> when might be the best time to write good selacon posts?

oh good question indeed.... i have the source material for a couple new ones already... so, i don't know about time of day, but:  in chrome OS, screens are split, drafting my shit up and keeping it thematically on point etc.... that's what.

> when might be the best time to make new selacon posts?

when i'm still feeling sharp. betwen work maybe. between booking and scraper; between scraper and x. idk. idr want to work on scraper today.


> what are you going to do today about the laptop repairs?

call the dude this aft and see hwat's up. verify my laptop's year as well.


> what's the thing you just //can't// go on without mentioning?

stress about work. i shouldn't be stressed about taksim for example - i shouldn't be doing it unless it's fun and unless the money's irrelevant. i guess the prospect of doing a CONTRACT is stressful. and work in general... i mean, the idea of "doing enough" for windfall, enough to get paid on it  at the end of t day .... the idea of still leaving time for my hobby projects ..... and yet my hobby projects hsould be all today, shouldn't they?


> okay, have a good day nick.
